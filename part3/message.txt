Computer science, a field so grand
A world of code, at our command
From simple programs to complex systems
We shape the future with our decisions

We design algorithms, both neat and clever
To make computers work better and faster
We analyze data, to find the truth
And build the networks that keep us connected, our youth

We create interfaces, that are user-friendly
And make the digital world accessible and handy
We simulate reality, in virtual space
And develop technologies, that will change the human race

Computer science, a journey so vast
A field that's always changing, ever-lasting
A challenge we take, with much excitement
To shape the world, with our digital brilliance.
