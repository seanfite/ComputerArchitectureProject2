In this programming assignment, I became much more proficient at reading in input files and 
which tools to use depending on the input data. I became more comfortable with troubleshooting
Java syntax as each programming assignment does. And finally, I become a lot better with playing
with data and getting it to do what I need. I think for part 1, I could've created better code if
I wrote out my helper methods on paper and used a linked list or ArrayList so i don't have repetitive 
code and so many different arrays. For part 2, I think there is also an easier way to create the 
desired output, using nested for loops. I went the array route so I had to track height and width with x and y ints and that complicated things a bit.
